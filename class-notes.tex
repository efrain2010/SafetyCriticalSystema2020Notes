%% Notes on formatting
%==============================================================================
% The first page, abstract and table of contents are numbered using Roman numerals and are not
% included in the page count. 
%
% From now on pages are numbered
% using Arabic numerals. Therefore, immediately after the first call to \chapter we need the call
% \pagenumbering{arabic} and this should be called once only in the document. 
%
%
% The first Chapter should then be on page 1. 

% PAGE LIMITS
% You are allowed 40 pages for a 40 credit project and 30 pages for a 
% 20 credit report. 
% This includes everything numbered in Arabic numerals (excluding front matter) up
% to but *excluding the appendices and bibliography*.
%
% FORMATTING
% You must not alter text size (it is currently 10pt) or alter margins or spacing.
% Do not alter the bibliography style. 
%
%==================================================================================================================================
%
% IMPORTANT
% The chapter headings and structure here are **suggestions**. You don't have to follow this model if
% it doesn't fit your project. Every project should have an introduction and conclusion,
% however.  If in doubt, your supervisor can give you specific guidance; their view takes precedence over
% the structure suggested here.

This is my first attempt to make clean notes about what happened in class. In this document you will find notes about Safety Critical System Class 2020

\chapter{Class Introduction}

Safety Governance, Market Focused
\begin{itemize}
    \item People buy things even if the probabilitties of death are high.
    \item Imperfect information. Companies not telling the truth about safety of their products
    \item $\theta$ Third party effect. Does apply for market forces, because it does not affect the buyer
    \item Some of the companies who causes detah to third parties, sometimes needs to pay for what their product caused
\end{itemize}

Tort and Insurance
\begin{itemize}
    \item Legal fees do not improve safety
    \item Some companies are just fine for what their product did, but that does not improve safety
    \item Companies often get insurance
    \item \underline{Moral hazard.} When companies feels very protected when they are sorrounded
    \item Government put limits (tops) to fines

    \item Process base Standar
\end{enumerate}

Process Base Standard

    \item Standards
    \item Steps
    \item Specifications
\end{itemize}

Standard IEC 61508 $\leftarrow$ $\theta$ and (26262) 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Functional Systems Standard
    \item $\neq$ Publishing Audible
    \item Electronic
    \item Electrical Electronic Programmable Systems
    \item Market forces are not enough $\rightarrow$ Standard
    \item Standards. Set of rules of conduct
    \item \textbf{*} Minor Changes. How much I have to change for the system is safe
\end{itemize}

\textbf{IEC 61508} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Programmable Systems
    \item Across the process industries
    \item Zero risk is impossible
    \item Reduce Risks
    \item Reduce unnacceptable RIsks
    \item Demonstrate Reductions
    \item Implics High Level od Documentation
    \item Equipment Under Control \textbf{(EUC)}
    \begin{itemize}
